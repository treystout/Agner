   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Agner 
================

Agner is named after [Agner Erlang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agner_Krarup_Erlang). It's about the simplest way to (ab)use Redis' atomic operations
to construct a queue. If you want to play around, I recommend starting at :ref:`installation`
and then moving on to :ref:`tutorial`

If you want to see how the sausage is made, check out the :ref:`api` docs.
