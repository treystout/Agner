Welcome to rjob
===============

rjob stands for Redis Job. It's about the simplest way to (ab)use Redis' atomic operations
to construct a queue. If you want to play around, I recommend starting at :ref:`installation`
and then moving on to :ref:`tutorial`

If you want to see how the sausage is made, check out the :ref:`api` docs.
